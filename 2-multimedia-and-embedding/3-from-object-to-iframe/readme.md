# From object to iframe â€” other embedding technologies

By now you should really be getting the hang of embedding things into your web pages, including images, video and audio. At this point we'd like to take somewhat of a sideways step, looking at some elements that allow you to embed a wide variety of content types into your webpages: the \<iframe\>, \<embed\> and \<object\> elements. \<iframe\>s are for embedding other web pages, and the other two allow you to embed external resources such as PDF files.
